Our Hospital Administration System is an application developed using React for the frontend and SQL Server for the database backend. This system empowers healthcare facilities to efficiently manage patient information, appointments, medical records, and billing. By leveraging the user-friendly interface of React and the robust data storage capabilities of SQL Server, we aim to enhance hospital operations, improve patient experiences, and ensure accurate data management within the medical environment.
